#Welcome to "Treat Your Self v. 1.0"
####a program to track how you're treating yourself as well as collecting ideas of how to treat yourself in the future

*Treat Your Self* makes use of the *d.i.a.n.e.* database to record when you treat your self as well as maintaining a running list of ways to treat yourself should you need inspiration. *TYR* was inspired by FBI special agent Dale Cooper who [shared his secret with the people of Twin Peaks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjkVgc6gIqk) about making sure to give yourself a present every day. And the name comes from [a special holiday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsABTmT1_M0) all about self-care started by Donna Meagle and Tom Haverford in Pawnee, Indiana.
