1. The HTML5 semantic tags are used to assign meaning to the content on your page. Now that I know what the main and section tags do, I think they will be very useful in putting together a page. The header and the footer also seem very useful to identify content that should be in the top or the bottom of the page.

2. The browser shows the elements on a page by the order the block elements are in the html. And the inline elements are then shown inside those block elements.

3. I learned how to create snippets, which are chunks of text that can be used as a template when creating an html file. Already I can see myself using these snippets and thinking about which ones to create next. I'll be on the lookout to notice which chunks of text I'm consonantly retyping, which would be easier to put inside a snippet.

4. The hardest part of this challenge was thinking about how to come up with examples to put inside the semantic tags. I think that this will come more naturally as I use them more and more. I'm already beginning to understand them better each time I use them with different content. Also, looking at a site's source code will be helpful to see how other people are writing html and using semantic tags.
