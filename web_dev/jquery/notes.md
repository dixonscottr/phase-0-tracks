#9.3 jQuery

#####Plan to casually approach jQuery:

* find intro articles on how jQuery is used
* look through some tutorials or introductory sites (like the one on W3 schools)
* look through docs (MDN, W3 schools, etc.)
* find cheat sheets
* find/watch a video on basic jQuery
* find/watch a video on someone walking through a jQuery project
* practice some of the techniques in a basic html document (maybe a copy of the chameleon one?)
* Try to explain to someone else what I learned (to solidify what I went over)
