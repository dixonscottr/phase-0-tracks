#9.3 jQuery

#####Plan to casually approach jQuery:

* find intro articles on how jQuery is used
* look through some tutorials or introductory sites (like the one on W3 schools)
* look through docs (MDN, W3 schools, etc.)
* find cheat sheets
* find/watch a video on basic jQuery
* find/watch a video on someone walking through a jQuery project
* practice some of the techniques in a basic html document (maybe a copy of the chameleon one?)
* Try to explain to someone else what I learned (to solidify what I went over)

######Resources I used:

* http://ejohn.org/apps/workshop/intro/
* http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/jquery-basics

######Notes on studying:

* Looking through some intro articles/slideshows at first helped to give me a good foundation to start exploring jQuery
* After looking through those, I looked at the docs for more on how jQuery is actually used
* Then I tried using jQuery on my own by practicing on the chameleon html file
* Afterwards, I spoke with a study group and explained a little about what I had found out about jQuery through my research
* All the above worked pretty well for basic research. I split up the studying into a couple of breaks, but mostly powered through the whole thing since I was focused
