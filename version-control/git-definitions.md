# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* **What is version control?  Why is it useful?**

Version control is a system that tracks the progress of a project by creating save points that record the changes to the project.

It's useful because by having the entire history of a project, you can go back to see when and where changes were made. Especially if there is a problem with the current program, you can go back to see where the problem was introduced and fix it.

* **What is a branch and why would you use one?**

A branch is a version of the code you're currently working on. It's suggested to always create a new branch when adding features to a program. That way if you make a mistake, the original code is still untouched. Using a branch is useful because you can experiment with different versions of the base code without worrying that you're going to "break" your code.

* **What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?**

A commit is a save point in your project that you can later on go back to or compare to more recent versions of your code. A good commit message should clearly say what your change to the code is, be under about 50 characters and in the imperative mood (Fixed, Add, Delete, etc.)

* **What is a merge conflict?**

A merge conflict is when there are different changes to the 2 branches being merged. For example, the feature-branch added a line, while the master branch had modified another line.
